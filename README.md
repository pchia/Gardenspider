Garden Spider

Garden spider is a 3D printed hexapod that is built do my yard work. It runs on a raspberry pi and Google AIY, and has 18 high torque 20kgcm servo motors. Using tensorflow, it classifies plants and determines if it is considered to be a pest (weeds), which it will then remove it with a built-in weed wacker or auger.
